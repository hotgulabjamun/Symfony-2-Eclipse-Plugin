<div id="validationf" class="featurediv">

	<p>Symfony elements can be validated by the plugin for syntax errors or other problems. For example you will see a validation error for unresolvable annotations:</p>
	<a class="lightbox" href="images/screenshots/annotationerror.png"><img src="images/screenshots/annotationerror_thumb.png"></img></a>
	
	<p>The severity level of those validation problems can be altered in the preference page of the Plugin ( or turned off completely).</p>
	<p>It's planned to validate additional elements with a corresponding quickfix solution, so these the validation error of a missing template will offer you quickfix to create that template for you.</p>
